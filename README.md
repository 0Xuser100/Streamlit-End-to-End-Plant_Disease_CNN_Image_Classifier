# 🌱 Streamlit End-to-End Plant Disease CNN Image Classifier

## 📌 Project Description
This project is an **End-to-End Plant Disease Classification** system that uses **Deep Learning** to identify and classify plant diseases from images. The model is based on a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** and is deployed using **Streamlit**, allowing users to upload plant leaf images and receive real-time disease predictions. This tool is particularly useful for **farmers, agricultural experts, and researchers** to detect plant diseases early and take preventive actions.

## 🚀 Features
- **Deep Learning-Based Image Classification** – Utilizes a **trained CNN model** to classify plant diseases.
- **Streamlit Web App** – Provides an easy-to-use interface for uploading images and obtaining instant predictions.
- **Image Preprocessing & Augmentation** – Enhances model performance with **data augmentation techniques**.
- **Explainable AI (Optional)** – Uses **Grad-CAM** to visualize model decisions.
- **Deployment Ready** – Can be deployed on **Streamlit Cloud** or **local servers**.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Python** – Core programming language.
- **TensorFlow/Keras** – Model training and evaluation.
- **OpenCV & PIL** – Image preprocessing.
- **Streamlit** – Interactive web application.
- **NumPy & Pandas** – Data handling.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Visualization of results.
